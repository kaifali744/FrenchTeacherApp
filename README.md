# FrenchTeacherApp
A simple Android app designed to teach users the names of colors in French. The main page features five buttons, each labeled with a different color. When a button is clicked, an audio file plays the name of the color in French. This app was created to practice using the `MediaPlayer` class in Android and handling multiple buttons.
